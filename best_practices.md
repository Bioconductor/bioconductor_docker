better maintain the Bioconductor Docker images and also community
contributions.

## How to contribute a new Docker image

1. The Docker image should be on a GitHub repository owned by the
   author. The name of the repository should follow the convention
   `bioconductor_docker_<image-name>`. All image names should be 
   lowercase.

1. Once the image is ready to be submitted, submit the repository as
   an [issue](https://github.com/Bioconductor/Contributions/issues/)
   through contributions page. For more instructions on how to submit,
   https://github.com/Bioconductor/Contributions.

1. The first iteration of the contribution should be developed from
   the "devel" (master branch) branch of the base image i.e
   `bioconductor/bioconductor_docker:devel`.

1. Once accepted, the repository will be cloned under the Bioconductor
   organization with full read/write access to the Github
   repository (https://github.com/Bioconductor).

1. The Docker Hub organization for Bioconductor will be controlled by
   the Core team, and builds will be triggered through a push to the
   GitHub repository which the maintainer will have access to. A
   new tag for a branch will be added by the Core team at the time of
   release to enable builds on Docker Hub. We hope to automate some of
   this in the future.

1. The author should demonstrate, through Docker Hub builds before
   acceptance, that the image builds successfully. This guide on
   Docker Hub is very helpful,
   https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/link-source/.

1. The repository should have an open source license in the
   LICENSE.txt file. Core Bioconductor packages are typically licensed
   under Artistic-2.0.

1. At the time of RELEASE, `bioconductor/bioconductor_docker` will
   provide a new RELEASE_X_Y branch. The core team will
   create a new branch in the Github repository with the tag
   `RELEASE_X_Y`. If the contributed image depends on `bioconductor/bioconductor_docker` 
   the tag will be updated to
   `bioconductor/bioconductor_docker:RELEASE_X_Y`.

## Best Practices and Standards for a Docker image and Dockerfile

1. For every repository submitted the Dockerfile is in the top level
   directory.

1. Docker images should be based on the
   `bioconductor/bioconductor_docker:devel` images, so that they can inherit
   all the installed packages and customization, but
   that is not strictly required.

1. Images should have a Dockerfile which is clearly defined and
   documented.

1. Images should clean up extraneous files created as part of the
   installation process, to optimize the space used by the image
   layers. Avoid reinstalling existing software, as this adds another 
   layer without removing the original installtion layer. Please 
   check https://www.fromlatest.io if you have any
   questions regarding how to optimize the Dockerfile.

1. The README.md file will act as the vignette for the images. The
   README.md should have a clear reasoning on *what* this Dockerfile
   provides, i.e additional tools or packages on top of
   bioconductor/bioconductor_docker. Remember there is very little
   value in providing the same image with a couple of extra
   packages on top of it as users can install these packages
   themselves.

1. Add metadata fields identifying the image in the Dockerfile like
   below,

```
LABEL name="bioconductor/bioconductor_docker_<image-name>" \
      version="0.99.0" \
      url="https://github.com/Bioconductor/bioconductor_docker_<image-name>" \
      maintainer="myname@email.com" \
      description="Description of my image" \
      license="Artistic-2.0"
```

   These Metadata fields allow the image to be identified by the
   user. 

1. Add build badges in your README.md file for the image. This can be
   easily generated by https://shields.io/category/build, like below

		[![Docker Build Status](https://img.shields.io/docker/cloud/build/bioconductor/bioconductor_docker.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/bioconductor/bioconductor_docker/builds/)

1. The `RELEASE_X_Y` image should be maintained without a build
   failure. Similar to packages, changes to the RELEASE_X_Y images should
   be for bug fixes only.

## Deprecation policy

We expect Docker images to follow the same deprecation policy as
[Bioconductor packages](http://bioconductor.org/developers/package-end-of-life/).

###  Criteria for image deprecation

1. `docker build` fails.

	The image must build successfully at each Bioconductor release. All
    efforts will be made to keep the image in Bioconductor if the
    maintainer is actively attempting to fix.

	If an image is broken for an extended period of time the
    maintainer will be given a final 6 week notice. If the image is
    not fixed by the end of the 6 weeks, an 'End-of-Life' process will
    be started.

1. Inactive maintainer

   The maintainer listed in the Dockerfile under `LABEL
   maintainer="maintainer@email.com"` must be responsive to questions
   on the support site, image related emails from users, build
   failures on Docker Hub and queries from Bioconductor team members. Broken
   images should be fixed in a timely manner.

   If you are unable to fix your image or no longer wish to maintain your image,
   please contact the [Bioc-devel mailing list][].

### End of Life process

**Step 1**: Deprecation

The `:devel` image will be marked with a *Deprecated* warning. The README file
of the Github repository will be updated, along with the build badge.

If at any time prior to the next release, the required criteria are met
(e.g., the image returns to active maintenance, perhaps after
‘adoption’ by a third party) the warning is removed.

**Step 2**: Defunct

Any `:devel` image marked *Deprecated*, at the start of a release cycle will be marked as *Defunct*.
At the start of the following release cycle, the image will be removed from the Bioconductor organization on Docker Hub.

For more details take a look at the Package deprecation page http://bioconductor.org/developers/package-end-of-life/.

### Reversing End of Life

A deprecated image can be un-deprecated if it is fixed before the next
Bioconductor release. To have an image un-deprecated, please contact
[Bioc-devel mailing list][].
